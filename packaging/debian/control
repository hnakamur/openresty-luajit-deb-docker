Description: Just in time compiler for Lua programming language version 5.1
 LuaJIT implements the full set of language features defined by Lua 5.1. The
 virtual machine (VM) is API- and ABI-compatible to the standard Lua interpreter
 and can be deployed as a drop-in replacement.  
 .
 This package contains the standalone interpreter/jitter that can be used
 as a replacement for the standard lua5.1 interpreter.

Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Just in time compiler for Lua - common files
 This package contains files needed by the LuaJIT interpreter/jitter as well
 by its embeddable (i.e. library) version.
